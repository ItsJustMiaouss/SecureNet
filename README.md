# SecureNet
üõ°Ô∏è A Chrome extension to secure your web browsing.

**Soon available on the Chrome Web Store!**

## About

SecureNet protects your navigation by recognizing the dangerous websites that you are visiting.

## How does it work?

When the extension is started, a list of dangerous domain names is fetched.
During your navigation, if one of the domains is contained in the list, a confirmation page will be opened. You can then either go back or continue.
